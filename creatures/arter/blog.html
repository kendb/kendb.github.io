          <span id="spanLeft">went to the record store with krypton again. not as packed as before which was nice. <br /><br />he's been introducing me to a lot of new artists recently. what he's shown me is the kind of stuff i didn't think i'd ever like but a lot of it's grown on me really fast. so much music.. </span>
          <span id="spanLeftComment" style="margin-top: 210px;">a picture of me holding nine inch nails' album the fragile bc it matches me pretty good ( pic taken by krypton) <br /><br /> i like the downward spiral more but the fragile is good too.</span>

        <div id="pictureBoxRight" style="margin-top: -40px;">
          <span id="spanRight" style="margin-top: 45px;">i don't usually go out to places with friends anymore for my reasons but i hope this happens more often. it felt good and if it doesn't happen again, something bad will happen... to krypton.. (not really) (maybe)</span>
          <span id="spanRightComment" style="margin-top: 195px;">met this person at the record store and he let me take a picture of him. his name was silico. he was massive.<br /><br />i don't usually take pictures of random people but he was huge. i wanted other people to see even though it doesn't really show it in the picture. whatever he was big and colorful and nice to me.</span>
